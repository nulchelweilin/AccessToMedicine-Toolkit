# Access-to-Medicine Strategy Toolkit

A living, open-source repository serving as a practical toolkit for pharmaceutical companies looking to develop or refine their strategies for improving access to medicine in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

## Purpose

This toolkit aims to promote transparency, collaboration, and shared learning across the pharmaceutical industry to accelerate progress in making essential medicines accessible to underserved populations.

## Guiding Principles

- **Patient-Centricity**: All strategies should prioritize patient needs and health outcomes.
- **Sustainability**: Solutions must be economically viable and environmentally sustainable in the long term.
- **Collaboration**: Success depends on partnerships with governments, NGOs, local communities, and other stakeholders.
- **Equity**: Ensure fair and equitable access regardless of geography or socioeconomic status.
- **Innovation**: Encourage novel approaches in pricing, distribution, and partnerships.

## How to Use This Toolkit

1. Browse the **frameworks** directory for strategic models (e.g., tiered pricing, voluntary licensing).
2. Use the **templates** directory for reusable documents (e.g., stakeholder mapping, partnership checklists).
3. Explore **case-studies** for anonymized examples of successful access programs.
4. Contribute your own insights, frameworks, or case studies via pull requests (see Contributing section below).
