# Tiered Pricing Guide

An effective tiered pricing model adapts medicine prices to the economic realities of different countries or populations while ensuring sustainability for manufacturers.

## Key Components

- **Market Segmentation**: Identify distinct customer groups based on ability to pay, often using World Bank income classifications (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, high income) or other relevant indicators.
- **Price Differentiation**: Set price tiers that reflect purchasing power parity, local market size, and competitive landscape.
- **Eligibility Criteria**: Establish clear, transparent rules for which countries or entities qualify for each price tier, often involving government agreements or validated procurement agencies.
- **Sustainability Considerations**: Ensure that lower-tier prices still cover marginal costs and contribute to R&D, while higher-tier prices support cross-subsidization and long-term innovation.
