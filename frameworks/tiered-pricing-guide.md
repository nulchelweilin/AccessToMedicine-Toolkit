# Tiered Pricing Guide

An effective tiered pricing model adapts medicine prices to the economic realities of different countries or populations while ensuring sustainability for manufacturers.

## Key Components

### 1. Market Segmentation
Identify distinct customer groups based on ability to pay, often using World Bank income classifications (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, high income) or other relevant indicators.

**Practical considerations:**
- Use local economic data (GDP per capita, healthcare spending, out-of-pocket expenditure).
- Consider disease burden and epidemiology to prioritize populations.
- Engage local stakeholders (ministries of health, NGOs, community representatives) to validate segmentation.

### 2. Price Differentiation
Set price tiers that reflect purchasing power parity, local market size, and competitive landscape.

**Approaches:**
- **Cost-plus pricing** for lowest tier covering marginal costs.
- **Value-based pricing** for higher tiers reflecting therapeutic value.
- **Reference pricing** based on prices of comparable medicines in the region.
- **Volume-based discounts** to encourage large-scale procurement.

### 3. Eligibility Criteria
Establish clear, transparent rules for which countries or entities qualify for each price tier, often involving government agreements or validated procurement agencies.

**Examples of criteria:**
- National income level (World Bank classification).
- Disease prevalence above a certain threshold.
- Commitment to use the medicine in public health programs.
- Existence of a functional regulatory and supply chain system.

### 4. Sustainability Considerations
Ensure that lower-tier prices still cover marginal costs and contribute to R&D, while higher-tier prices support cross-subsidization and long-term innovation.

**Balancing act:**
- Calculate minimum sustainable price for each tier.
- Consider parallel trade and diversion risks.
- Plan for periodic price adjustments based on inflation, currency fluctuations, and market changes.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Stakeholder Mapping**: Identify key actors (governments, insurers, providers, patient groups) and their influence.
2. **Data Collection**: Gather economic, epidemiological, and market data for target countries.
3. **Model Development**: Build a pricing model that incorporates costs, volumes, and affordability thresholds.
4. **Negotiation Preparation**: Develop negotiation guidelines and fallback positions.
5. **Agreement Drafting**: Create legally sound tiered pricing agreements with clear terms.
6. **Launch & Communication**: Roll out the pricing scheme with clear messaging to avoid confusion or backlash.
7. **Monitoring & Evaluation**: Track uptake, financial sustainability, and health impact.

## Legal and Regulatory Considerations

- **Competition/Antitrust Laws**: Ensure tiered pricing does not violate local or international competition regulations.
- **Intellectual Property**: Align with TRIPS flexibilities and local patent laws.
- **Contract Law**: Draft agreements that are enforceable in relevant jurisdictions.
- **Import/Export Regulations**: Understand customs duties, taxes, and regulatory approvals for each country.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
  - Volume of medicine sold in each tier.
  - Revenue per tier and overall profitability.
  - Patient access metrics (number of patients treated, geographic coverage).
  - Impact on disease burden (e.g., reduction in morbidity/mortality).
- **Feedback Loops**: Regular reviews with stakeholders to adapt the model as needed.

## Communication and Transparency

- **External Communication**: Clearly explain the rationale for tiered pricing to avoid perceptions of price discrimination.
- **Internal Alignment**: Ensure sales, marketing, and supply chain teams understand and support the strategy.
- **Public Reporting**: Consider publishing aggregated data on pricing and access outcomes to build trust.

## Case Examples

*Example 1: Antiretroviral (ARV) pricing for HIV treatment*
- Global fund partnerships enabled tiered pricing across >100 countries.
- Lowest tier prices reached <$100 per patient per year.
- Results: dramatic scale-up of treatment in sub-Saharan Africa.

*Example 2: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) Advanced Market Commitment*
- Donor-funded advance purchase guarantee allowed manufacturers to offer low prices to Gavi‑eligible countries.
- Prices dropped by >90% over a decade, enabling widespread introduction.

## Conclusion

Tiered pricing is a powerful tool for improving access while maintaining a sustainable business model. Success depends on careful design, robust stakeholder engagement, and continuous learning from implementation.
